    "\n",
    "#### The Problem \n",
    "        Topic modeling is a fun way to start the study of NLP. We will use two popular matrix decomposition techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "        We start with a term-document matrix:\n",
    "\n",
    "        We can decompose this into one tall think matrix times one wide short matrix (possibly with a diagnol matrix in between).\n",
    "\n",
    "        Notice that this representation does not take into account word order or sentence structure. It's an example of a bag of words approach.\n",
    "\n",

    "### Motivation\n",
    "     Consider the most extreme case - reconstructing the matrix using an outer product of two vectors. In most of the cases we won't be able to reconstruct the matrix exactly. But if we had one vector with the relative frequency of each vocabulary word out of the total word count,and one with the average number of words per document, then that outer product be as close as we can get.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "     Now consider increasing that matrices to two columns and two rows. The optimal decomposition would now be to cluster the document into two groups, each of which has as different distribution of words as possible to each other, but as similar as possible amongst the document in the cluster. We will call those two groups \"topics\". And we ould cluster the words into two groups, based on those which most frequently appear in each of the topics."

It is evident that the West, especially America,\\nmisjudged Hussein drastically.  But once Hussein invaded Kuwait and \\nthreatened to militarily corner a significant portion of the world\\'s\\noil supply, he had to be stopped.  Sure the war could have been\\nprevented by judicious and concerted effort on the part of the West\\nbefore Hussein invaded Kuwait, but it is still *Hussein* who is\\nresponsible for his decision to invade.  And once he did so, a\\nstrong response from the West was required.\\n\\n\\nWell, it\\'s not very \"loving\" to allow a Hussein or a Hitler to gobble up\\nnearby countries and keep them.  Or to allow them to continue with mass\\nslaughter of certain peoples under their dominion.  So, I\\'d have to\\nsay yes, stopping Hussein was the most \"loving\" thing to do for the\\nmost people involved once he set his mind on military conquest.\\n\\nI mentioned it.\\n\\nIf we hadn\\'t intervened, allowing Hussein to keep Kuwait, then it would\\nhave been appeasement.  It is precisely the lessons the world learned\\nin WW2 that motivated the Western alliance to war.  Letting Hitler take\\nAustria and Czechoslavkia did not stop WW2 from happening, and letting\\nHussein keep Kuwait would not have stopped an eventual Gulf War to\\nprotect Saudi Arabia.\\n\\n\\nSure.  What was truly unfortunate was that they followed Hitler in\\nhis grandiose quest for a \"Thousand Year Reich\".  The consequences\\nstemmed from that.\\n\\nWhat should I say about them?  Anything in particular?\\n\\n\\n\\nSo?  It was the *policemen* on trial not Rodney King!!  And under American\\nlaw they deserved a jury of *their* peers!  If there had been black\\nofficers involved, I\\'m sure their would have been black jurors too.\\nThis point (of allegedly racial motivations) is really shallow.\\n\\n\\nSo?

So one cannot conclude either way due to\\nthe silence of the principals.  \\n\\n\\nOK.  It certainly seemed to me that there was excessive force involved.\\nAnd frankly, the original \"not guilty\" verdict baffled me too.  But then\\nI learned that the prosecution in the first case did not try to convict\\non a charge of excessive force or simple assault which they probably\\nwould have won, they tried to get a conviction on a charge of aggravated\\nassault with intent to inflict serious bodily harm.  A charge, which\\nnews commentators said, was akin to attempted murder under California\\nlaw.  Based on what the prosecution was asking for, it\\'s evident that \\nthe first jury decided that the officers were \"not guilty\".  Note, \\nnot \"not guilty\" of doing wrong, but \"not guilty\" of aggravated assault \\nwith the *intent* of inflicting serious bodily harm.  The seeds of the \\nprosecutions defeat were in their own overconfidence in obtaining a \\nverdict such that they went for the most extreme charge they could.\\n\\nIf the facts as the news commentators presented them are true, then\\nI feel the \"not guilty\" verdict was a reasonable one.\\n\\n\\nThanks mathew, I like the quote.

    "\n",
    "    Notes :\n",
    "        1. For NMF, the matrix needs to be at least as tall as it is wide, or we get an error with fit transform\n",
    "        2. Can use df_min inn CountVectorizer to only look at words that were in at least k of the split texts\n",
    "\n",
    "### Truncated SVD\n",
    "    We saved a lot of time, when we calculated NMF by only calculating the subset of columns we were intrested in. Is there a way to get this benefit in SVD? Yes ther is, It's called truncated SVD. We are just intrested in the vectors corresponding to the largest singular values\n",
